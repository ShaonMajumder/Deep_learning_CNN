# Deep_learning_CNN
Convolution Neural Network Code


## Trial 1
Convolutional Layer: 2
input_shape = (64,64,3)
No Dropout rate added.
Accuracy on test set = 78%

## Trial 2
Convolutional Layer: 3
input_shape = (128,128,3)
Added Dropout for avoiding over fitting. Dropout rate = 0.5
With these changes acc of test set has being increased to 88%
