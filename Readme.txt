Problem Statement:
Problem statement is classify image of cat or dog.

Here we have data set on cat and dog. I have build CNN model to classify them.
I have shown very simple way to build CNN using keras.

Model achieved accuracy of :
Traning accuracy = 98%
Test accuracy = 88%

These accuracy can be increased by using better input_shape and by adding more convolution layer.

I have also show how to Making single prediction, that given a single image model to predict image is of cat or dog ??
